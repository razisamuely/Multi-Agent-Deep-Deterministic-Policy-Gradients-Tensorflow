# Multi-Agent-Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradients-Tensorflow

Creating multi agent model using Twnsorflow 

The repository heavily relies on philtabor [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/philtabor/Multi-Agent-Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradients) for [Multi Agent Actor Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf)

Make sure you installing the [Multi Agent Particle Environment(MAPE)](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) as detailed.
